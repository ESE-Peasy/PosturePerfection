  We are a group of 5th Year Electronics & Software Engineering students at the University of Glasgow, completing a project which provides you with real-time notifications when we detect you have adopted a poor seated posture which could be detrimental to your future health.
</div>

With the rapidly increased number of individuals around the world being forced to "work from home", we are aware that many of you have far from ideal setups for your working day, with a lack of office-made chairs and desks as you spend the majority of your day at your work device. Naturally this leads to significant discomfort as you might find yourself gradually slouching further and further into your desk over the course of the day. Not only does this lead to immediate pain in the form of a strained neck or a sore back, but further down the line this can lead to even more significant health impacts. The main difficulty with this is that you may not even notice just how poor your posture is when you are seated for extensive periods of time!

Therefore we wanted to create a system which notifies you when it detects a poor posture. This should encourage you to try and resolve the problem, but we are also hoping to incorporate a system which provides you with real-time visual feedback to guide you back to a "good" posture.
