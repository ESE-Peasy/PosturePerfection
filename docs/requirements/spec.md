# Specification

|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The main system must be able to run as a standalone application on a Raspberry Pi           | 
| It must run using a single camera attached to the Raspberry Pi                              |
| The system should work with sensible default settings such that initialisation of PosturePerfection is straightforward           |
| Customisable settings/options must be presentable and configurable with minimal overhead    |
| The system should act as a "posture warning system" which warns the user within X seconds of their posture worsening. A "bad" posture is defined [here](tbc)    |
| The warning defined must initially at a minimum be in the form of an obvious notification to the user. The exact nature of this notification is yet to be decided    |
| The system should also incorporate a "posture correction" aspect which can guide the user to "good" posture as defined [here](tbc)    |
| The system could be extended to make use of a GUI via a small/medium sized HDMI-connected screen    |
| Optionally, the system could also send a notification to the main work machine of the user, so that they are immediately made aware of worsened posture, and so that they can turn to the posture correction tool for guidance    |
