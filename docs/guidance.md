# Locally editing the website

#### We will remove this page in the future, but it is useful if anyone else wants to update the website.

* Ensure you have `Jekyll`and its pre-requisites (mainly `Ruby` and `RubyGems`) installed. See [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
* Navigate to the `docs/` directory
* Execute the following in your command line:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

After a few seconds this should give you an output as follows:

```
...
LiveReload address: http://127.0.0.1:35729
Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000
Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

* Navigate to the server address specified
* Make changes as required and the webpage will automatically be updated. See [here](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/)
for customisation options for the theme we are using. (Feel free to change the theme, I just thought this one works well for
simplicity and how easy it is to add content)
* Note - if you modify the `_config.yml` file you will need to restart the server by executing step 3
